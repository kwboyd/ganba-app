## Ganba! Flashcards for Japanese Learners

Ganba! (trans: do your best!) is an app that can be used to memorize Japanese vocabulary through quizzes on pronunciations and meanings. This app targets intermediate to advanced Japanese learners who struggle to find convenient ways to study Japanese because of the facets of Japanese vocabulary (such as kanji/furigana) that traditional multi-language study programs do not account for. This app also provides an option to create example sentences for each word. Through [Wanakana's](http://wanakana.com/) library, this app auto-converts romaji text input for pronunciation to furigana without the need for an IME to allow for a faster quizzing experience.

This app was built using [Laravel 5](https://laravel.com).
